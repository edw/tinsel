# tinsel

Tinsel: shiny threading macros with tracing.

Why the name? [Because](http://doc.poseur.com/xmas-eve-macros).

## Installation

Add this dependency to your `project.clj`:

```
[edw/tinsel "0.2.0"]
```

## Usage

Wouldn't it be nice to use the threading macros (`->`, `->>`) but be
able to see what the intermediate values are? I know, I know, that
would be great, wouldn't it?

[Psst, before going any further, type this into your REPL:
`(require '[tinsel.core :refer [=> =>>]])`.]

So what if this code:

    (let [a 61
          [result trace]
          (=> (inc a)
               inc
               dec
               (fn [x] (+ x 1))
               #(- % 1)
               (+ 1)
               (* 2)
               (/ 3))]
      (clojure.pprint/pprint {:result result
                              :trace trace}))

Produced this output?

    {:result 42,
     :trace
     [[(inc a) 62]
      [inc 63]
      [dec 62]
      [(fn [x] (+ x 1)) 63]
      [(fn* [p1__31059#] (- p1__31059# 1)) 62]
      [(+ 1) 63]
      [(* 2) 126]
      [(/ 3) 42]]}
